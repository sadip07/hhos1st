# Advanced DDoS Toolkit

A comprehensive toolkit for DDoS attack simulation and protection, developed for educational and security testing purposes.

## üìã Overview

This toolkit includes:

1. **DDoS Attack Tool**: A powerful multi-threaded DDoS attack simulator supporting various attack methods
2. **Protection Bypass Tool**: Analyzes target defenses and recommends optimal attack parameters
3. **Protection Tools**: Scripts for traffic analysis, rate limiting, and web monitoring
4. **Educational Resources**: Documentation about DDoS attacks and protection strategies

> **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: This toolkit should **ONLY** be used in controlled environments with proper authorization. Usage against unauthorized targets is illegal and unethical.

  - IP spoofing and randomization capabilities
  - Real-time statistics and colorized output

- **bypass_protection.py**: Protection analysis and bypass tool:
  - Detects WAFs, CDNs, rate limiting, and other protections
  - Recommends optimal attack parameters for specific targets
  - Can automatically execute optimized attacks

- **test_your_defenses.py**: Safe tool for testing your own infrastructure

### Protection and Analysis Tools

- **tools/rate_limiter.py**: Connection rate limiting implementation
- **tools/web_monitor.py**: Web interface for monitoring traffic
- **tools/security_config.py**: Security configuration utilities
- **tools/test_generator.py**: Traffic generation for testing defenses

### Documentation and Guides

- **USAGE.md**: Detailed instructions for using the attack tools
- **MITIGATION.md**: Comprehensive guide on DDoS mitigation strategies
- **DDoS_Information.md**: Technical information about attack types and impacts

## üì• Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ddos-toolkit.git
   cd ddos-toolkit
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have proper permissions (some features require administrative/root privileges).

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. DDoS Attack Tool

Standard usage:
```bash
python ddos_tool.py <target_ip> -t <attack_type> -d <duration> -r <rate> -n <threads>
```

Example (SYN flood):
```bash
python ddos_tool.py 192.168.1.10 -t syn -d 30 -r 500 -n 5
```

### 2. Protection Bypass Tool

Analyze a target and get recommended attack parameters:
```bash
python bypass_protection.py <target_ip> -p <port>
```

Analyze and automatically execute the optimized attack:
```bash
python bypass_protection.py <target_ip> -p <port> --execute
```

Save analysis results to a JSON file:
```bash
python bypass_protection.py <target_ip> -p <port> --output results.json
```

### 3. Safe Defense Testing

Test your own infrastructure with limited impact:
```bash
python test_your_defenses.py <your_server> -t http
```

### 4. Protection Tools

Traffic Analyzer:
```bash
python tools/traffic_analyzer.py --interface eth0 --threshold 100
```

Rate Limiter:
```bash
sudo python tools/rate_limiter.py --port 80 --max-rate 100
```

Web Monitor:
```bash
python tools/web_monitor.py
# Then access http://localhost:5000
```
